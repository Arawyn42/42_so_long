## <div align="center">üìÑ Introduction</div>
This is the first graphic project in the 42 cursus.

It consists in creating a litle 2D video games with simple rules: there is a map in input, which gives the start position of the player, the position of the collectible items, and the exit position.

The player has to collect all of the items and to walk on the exit to finish the game. The less moves he does, the better score he obtaines.

**Bonus points are given if:**
- some sprites are animated;
- the score is displayed directly in the game's window;
- there are enemies and the player can lose if he touches one of them.

**For this project, we could use the following functions:**

- open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit
- math.h library
- MiniLibX library
<br>
All other existing functions or libraries were forbidden, and we had to use the given version of the MiniLibX, which is a small graphic library for C graphic projects at 42 School.
